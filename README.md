# Hangman Game

Welcome to my Python project for the Hangman game! ðŸŽ¯

In this project, I've implemented the classic Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word.

## Game Overview

The game starts with a hidden word, and the player guesses letters one at a time. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn. The goal is to guess the word before the stick figure is fully drawn.

Hereâ€™s a preview of the game in action:
